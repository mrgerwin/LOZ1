This is a Lesson on Sprite Animation.  If following along in the video, use a blank file for game.py and program with me.  If you run into issues you can compare it to the completed file game.py

Ideas for extensions
-Make an animation for link dying.  In the original game link's death animation is left, down, right repeated several times before disappearing.  This gives the illusion that he is spinning before dying.  Make it happen when we press the "d" key.  See this video for a demonstation https://youtu.be/DgzDC1XP4AI?t=12
